        "After attending the Latinas in Tech Conference in 2024, I was reminded of the Latina wage gap in the U.S. It is significant, with Latinas earning considerably less than non-Hispanic white men. This disparity affects the economic stability of Latina workers and their families. We propose an AI-powered Latina Wage Calculator to provide personalized wage estimates, career advice, and negotiation strategies based on user qualifications, market data, and user data. The goal is to close the wage gap and promote wage equity for Latinas. We want to build a platform where the “cheat codes” that work for latinas by latinas, can be found.\n",
